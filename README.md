Pizza Map with Custom Annotation Views

###About
This app takes advantage of Apple's MapKit framework and custom annotation views to display pizza locations that are downloaded
from a JSON format web service. When selecting a pizza location, store information such as the phone number, address and store hours
are displayed to provide the user with additional information.
